# no-more-copper
I do not like copper in Minecraft Bedrock Edition. This is my attempt to eradicate it from the game.

Edit this pack all I want and upload it all you want. I don't care. Just make sure to either delete the last one or change the manifest.json uuid values before opening in game so that they don't conflict.
